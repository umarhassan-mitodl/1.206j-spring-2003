Academic Honesty Policy
-----------------------

The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering adheres to the strictest standards of academic honesty. An important aspect of achieving these standards is to be sure that students are aware of expectations of faculty regarding academic honesty. This statement clarifies the faculty's expectations in 1.206J.

Assignments
-----------

Assignments performed by students for submission have a dual purpose. They are intended as educational devices, including the teaching of skills such as working in teams. They are also evaluation tools for the faculty in judging the quality of performance of individual students. Our policies are intended to balance these two purposes and, unless otherwise stated, these policies apply to all assignments.

Students **currently** taking this class can work together to conceptualize general approaches to assignments. However, unless otherwise specified for a particular assignment, the work you submit should be done completely on your own. This includes text, numerical calculations, mathematical derivations, diagrams, graphs, computer programs and output.

**Reference any written source you use in your submission.**

In-class Exams
--------------

All work on in-class exams should be performed only by you. Materials you can bring into the examination will be specified by the faculty for each exam.

If you have any questions about how these policies relate to a specific situation, you should speak to Professor Barnhart.
